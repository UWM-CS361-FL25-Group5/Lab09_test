Group Charter: Your Team Name
Meetings: List time

Group Contacts:
  ntassone@uwm.edu
  mmannino@uwm.edu
  ndghanty@uwm.edu
  saleemm@uwm.edu

Goals:
  - Each group member is expected to respect each other.
  - Work together as a group to create a quality product by trying their best
  - Gain experience working in a SCRUM environment

Work Norms:
  - It is expected that each group member puts forward a time commitment. The time commitment may be subjective, depending on the task or person 
  responsible. The expectation is that the group member completes their given task. If a group member starts to noticeably lag behind others, the group
  will analyze whether or not a workload change is needed.
  - The work habits of each group member are not going to be micro-managed. However, it is expected of the group member to communicate along the way. If a
  group member begins to produce low quality work, late work, miss work, and lack communication the group may then come together to manage the issue with
  that group member as outlined using group rules.

Ground Rules:
Meetings:
1. Length of meetings:
-Metting will be around 15 - 30 minutes.
2. Missing a meeting:
-If it is unexcused and they have missed multiple meetings—more than 3—they will have 5 points taken from them.
3. Tardiness to meetings:
-If it is unexcused and they have been late more than 3 times they lose 4 points.
4. Phone use during meetings:
-If it is unexcused and they have done it multiple times throughoutthe meeting, they will have 4 points taken away. 
5. Food and drink during meetings:
-If it is not a distraction to the meeting, it is fine; otherwise, if it is a distraction to the meeting and the person refuses to stop, they will have 2 points taken away. 
Group communication and interaction:
1. Regular communication:
Group Charter: Your Team Name
Regular communication should occur every two days via email. This communication
should include a simple update on ones progress of their portion of the project. When a
member finishes their portion of the project, they should attach their finished product in
an email to all group members. If it cannot be attached to the email, the member shall
explain a way to view the finished product. If a member forgets to post progress, any
member can send an inquiry email to the person who forgot. If the email is not responded
to in 24 hours, the group will begin to take on that member‟s responsibilities through the
decision making process stated in part six of this section. If the member has a good
reason for not responding, it will be taken into consideration as to whether there will be
disciplinary action; otherwise it will be an immediate minor offense. If however, the
member responds within the 24 hour time period stating they forgot, no disciplinary
action will be taken. If a member is having problems with their portion of the work, they
should let the rest of the group knew immediately so they can received any needed help
as soon as possible.
2. Group communication on tardiness/missed meetings and meeting information:
If a member has prior knowledge of a missed meeting or tardiness of a day or more, that
member shall send an email to all group members signifying such. If it is the day of the
meeting and a group member is going to miss the meeting or knows they are going to be
tardy by more than five minutes, that member shall send a text message to all group
members informing them of the situation. Failure to do so more than once will result in a
minor offense.
3. Communication ethics:
There shall be an understanding among group members that all opinions or input by any
individual member is valued and will be respected, even if disagreed with. People and/or
their opinions shall not in any way be degraded or dismissed but all opinions shall have
equal consideration. If a member feels his opinions are being rejected without good
reason, he has a right to bring it up to the group leader and/or the group. The group will
then discuss the situation and either reconsider their opinions, or make a case as to why
the members opinions are not being used. If there is such a disagreement, the note taker
or agenda maker will record the situation as well as the member who feels disregarded. If
this situation happens more than three times the member has a right to go to the TA and
state their case. If the problem is not solved by the TA, the opportunity is then open to
state their case to Rock.
4. Group structure:
The group shall have the following roles to help the group be more efficient:
Yoda – This role belongs to the group leader. This jedi master is responsible for the flow
of the meeting and has a helpful role in the delegation of responsibilities.
R2-D2 – This role belongs to the meeting note taker. This droid is responsible to take
notes at all the meetings and to relay the important information and any decisions made
during the meeting to the other members via email by the end of the next day. They will
also be responsible for recording any disciplinary actions taken toward any member of
the group.
Group Charter: Your Team Name
Han Solo – This role belongs to the agenda maker. This member of the rebellion is
responsible for making an agenda of subjects which need to be covered in the upcoming
meeting. The agenda shall be emailed to the group before Saturday for a Monday meeting
and three days before any other meeting.
If any member in a role does not follow through with his responsibilities on multiple
occasions or if for some reason a member is not able to perform their duties, they shall be
replaced by group decision.
5. Decision making:
Any decisions which need to be made about the project, project direction or disciplinary
action will be made by a majority vote. Any decisions about delegation will be covered in
part six.
6. Group decisions on delegation:
The delegation of responsibilities to group members will be decided in the following
fashion. The responsibilities will be discussed and decided on as a group decision. Then
each group member has the opportunity to volunteer for the task he may want. If a group
member does not volunteer for a task, they will be assigned one by Yoda. If a group
member feels the portion of responsibility is unfair, they may voice their concern and
state a reason why. If a majority of the group feels this member is correct, the
responsibilities will be reformed and the delegation process will start again.
Group participation and work quality
1. Group participation:
If a group member isn‟t participating or is over participating it will be the Yoda‟s
responsibility to politely ask the member to share either more or less based on the
situation. If some is asked to share what they think or is asked to give others a chance to
share, but they do not, and their under or over sharing is blocking the flow of the meeting,
then by group decision it may be considered a minor offense.
2. Work not up to standard:
Group standards, regarding quality and timeliness of work, are important to uphold if we
aim to succeed as a group. With goal 2 in mind we should always be putting forth the
effort necessary to submit our best work. However, if there is a problem it should be
handled in the following manner. It is understandable that at some point in this project
someone may not be able to put in the time or effort necessary to meet group standards. If
that should happen he must notify the group as soon as possible so the task can be
redistributed, using the system established in group decisions and delegation, and the
group can continue functioning at its highest level. If he continues to repeat this behavior
it may result in a minor or major offence depending on the severity. In any case a minor
offence must be given to the individual, for this action, before a major offence can be. At
some point the group may seize to offer work to him as he is untrustworthy at that point.
However, a group member may be able to redeem himself. If said member continues to
perform above expectations for at least two weeks he shall be returned to full member
status by way of this clause.

3. Group members unprepared:
It is understood that people are busy with other classes and school work. If by group
consciousness it is obvious that a member is unprepared for a meeting, and their
unpreparedness creates a hindrance to the group and project, then disciplinary action will
have to take place. Unpreparedness of this form will immediately result in a warning then
a minor offence hereafter.
4. Workload too heavy:
If with the time restraints and number of group members actively participating is not
sufficient enough to complete the task, a plea of mercy will be sent to the Rock via email
and in person which logs the details of the amount of work to be done, the status of how
far we are, and why we can‟t complete it in that time period.
Disciplinary Procedures:
1. Regarding disciplinary actions:
Any disciplinary action to be administered can be overridden by group conscience, if
decided by a majority vote.
2. Disciplinary Log:
The note taker will be responsible for logging any information on offenses committed by
any member. This report will be sent out with the meeting notes every week so each
member knows where they stand.
3. Minor Group Offence:
A minor group offence can occur for breaking indicated statutes of the charter. Minor
offences require the offender to be labeled as “Storm trooper” for their stupidity. The
storm trooper is required to prepare a delicious baked treat good either homemade or
store bought within the next two meetings. Failure to do so will escalate them to the next
level of offence. A record of the minor offence and when the delicious baked treat arrived
will be recorded by the group assigned note taker.
4. Major Group Offence:
A major group offence can occur by breaking indicated statutes of the charter, or for
accumulation of 3 or more minor offences. Major offences require that the offender be
labeled as “Anakin Skywalker” for his treachery. Anakin Skywalker is on probation and
his probation status is to be clearly documented by email including a detailed description
of his offence. Anakin Skywalker may return to regular group member status upon a
group consensus. If Anakin Skywalker commits another offence constituted as either
minor or major, he will become a candidate for punishment and dismissal.
5. Punishment and Dismissal:
A group member committing enough minor and major offences will finally have gone to
the dark side and demoted to Darth Vader. They will be referred to punishment and
dismissal and will be given over to review by the TA and governing bodies (the Rock).
An email describing the offences leading up to punishment and dismissal will be
Group Charter: Your Team Name
displayed along with testimonies from at least 2 other group members and a log of
offenses. If available, the offending members work will be confiscated and termed as
“belonging to the group”.
We, the team named ________ agree with the Group Charter and will try our best to uphold it.
